/*
    Important points

        1. Execution of a C program starts from main()
        2. A C program can have more than one function
        3. Every function gets called directly or indirectly from main()
        4. There are two types of functions in C.

    Let't talk about them.

    Types of functions

        Library Functions -> commonly required functions grouped together in a library file on disk.

        User defied functions -> These are the functions declared and defined by the users.

    Why use functions?

        1. To avoid rewriting the same logic again and again.
        2. To keep track of what we are doing in a program.
        3. To test and check logic independently.
