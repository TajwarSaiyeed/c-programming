        Types of function calls
        Based on the way we pass arguments to
        the function, function calls are of two
        types.


        Call by value => sending the values of arguments
        Call by reference => sending the "address of" arguments

        Call by value

        Here the value of the arguments are passed to the function consider this example:

        int c = sum(3,4) => assume x=3 and y = 4
                    x, y
