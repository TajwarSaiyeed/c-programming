/*
    Loops Control instruction

    WHY LOOPS:
        Sometimes we want our programs to execute few set of instructions over and over again.
        for ex:
          @printing 1 to 100, first 100 ever numbers etc;


          Hence loops make it easy for a programmer to tell
          computer that given a set of instructions must be
          executed repeatedly.

    @Types of Loops:
        Primarily there are three types of loops in C language.

    1. while loop
    2. do-while loop
    3. for loop
